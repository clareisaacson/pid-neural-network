# PID Neural Network
A basic neural network implemented in Python 2. The repository includes three versions of the network that increase in complexity.

### General Neural Network Information

Each network is implemented as a class object. It's randomized weights along with other relevent data are initialized in the init function. They includes methods for forward propagation (including a sigmoid activation function used in forward prop.), backpropagation, training, and testing.

### The Baseline Network

Relevant Files:
- neural_net_baseline.py
- test_xor_baseline.py

The basic neural network has a single hidden layer. The number of inputs, hidden units, and output units is adjustable

### Intermediate Network

Relevant Files:
- pid_neural_net_xor.py
- test_pid_xor.py

### The PID Problem

### The PID Visualizer
Relevant Files:
- visualizer.py
- visualizer_sample.py

### The PID Network

This network 

### Getting Started

This project requires a version of [Numpy] that works with Python 2. (http://www.numpy.org)
